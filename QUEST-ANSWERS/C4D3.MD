1. Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.
> 1. To wrap all NFTs in 1 resource
> 2. To allow other accounts to deposit into the collection.

2. What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")
> You'll have to declare a destroy() function to get rid those "nested" resources.

3. Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

Idea .1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.
> If you're planning on giving out NFTs for free and for anyone, then Yes.
> But if specific requirements need to be met before the NFT can be minted, then No.
> Think of whitelists in projects, or the superspecial EC Acadamy POAP which I'm about to earn!

Idea .2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?
> Considering the strict boundaries of an NFT Resource, you'd have to move it out of the Collection, read the information, and move it back in. 
> To avoid moving these NFT Resources around all the time, you're better off by using References.
