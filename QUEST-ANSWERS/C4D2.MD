1. What does `.link()` do?
> You can use `.link()` in a function to create a capability that "links" `storage/YourResource` to `storage/public` (for public access) or to `storage/private` (for private access).

2. In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the `/public/` path.
> First, in the Contract, you create a Resource Interface that holds the data fields of the Resource that you choose to expose to the public.
> Once a Transaction saves the Resource to the Account Storage, you're able to expose the Resource's data by linking the Resource Interface to the `/public` path.

3. Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:

    1) In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.

    2) Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.

    3) Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.
